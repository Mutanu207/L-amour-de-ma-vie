            <span>Hello my love</span> When I saw you the first time,i felt something i had not felt for a long time.
            I fell in love with you instantly and always wanted to be aorund you,making excuses,to see you everyday.
            Seeing you,talking to you,being around you became the only thing i wanted to do. I guess you aslo did,i have just rembered
            the day we first held hands ,i felt everything at that moment,I knew I wanted to be with you.Then we finally kissed, on the rooftop and i was so happy.
            I think i would have cried ,but I wanted to seem cool : ). But that kiss made me feel so much emotions,I cannot explain them. And then began our journey,
            with our smiles,the fun part,the happy times and the sad times.We are not perfect,but i love it,I love being messy because of you. You made me believe 
            i am capbale of love when i thought i wasn't,I never thought anyone would actually have feelings for me ,but you did and i'm so happy you took a chance on me.
            Because honestly with you I stop feeling lost,I stop feeling like I don't belong, all the voices in my head go quiet, when im in your arms.Im not lying when I say 
            its the best place on earth for me. I want to be glued to your arms forever,so that i never let you go.The only place i am safe at. I know i show so many insecurites
            but its because i have never been loved like you do. So its so unreal when you tell me that you love me and that im yours. I wish i could hear you say it all the time so 
            that i could believe it. Because i really dont know how to express my feelings,but been with you makes me vulnerable,and your forehead kisses brings out another side of me 
            i never thought i had. I really never knew love , I actually had to google it when I was falling in love with you.I could not explain what I was feeling and I love that you do that 
            to me. I love what you do to my body,my mind,my heart.You gave me the defenition of love ,one I never I could get. Thats why im here writing,and all im thinking is your lips on mine.
            ,and your smiles in between,and your hand placements ,and how you are gentle around me.I would never want you to leave,i need to be next you.That is where i belong,Im happy being yours.
